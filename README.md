# What is this project
This is the recipe web page project from the Odin Project. The project instructs
that, upon completion, I should have a web page written in pure HTML, that shows
several of my favorite recipes and provides working links for them.

# What will be demonstrated
Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated my understanding of HTML,
Git, and GitHub. Mainly I will have showcased the use of basic HTML boilerplate,
as well as common HTML elements. Furthermore, I will have showcased my abilitly
to use Git locally for a project in tandem with GitHub remotely to track the
progress of my project.
